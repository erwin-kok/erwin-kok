👋 **Hi, I'm Erwin Kok**

**Senior Software Engineer • 30+ Years Experience • Distributed Systems & Open-Source Enthusiast**
*(Most of my open-source work is built in my spare time — but I’m steadily expanding it.)*

I build scalable distributed systems, experiment with emerging networking protocols, and contribute to open-source technologies that power resilient, modern infrastructure. I enjoy designing clean architectures, mentoring engineers, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with Kotlin, Rust (still learning), and modern networking stacks.

🚀 **What I Work On**

**Distributed Computing / P2P Systems**

Design and prototyping of resilient, fault-tolerant peer-to-peer systems.

**Networking & Protocols**

QUIC, HTTP/3, CNI, service meshes, high-performance transport layers.

**Microservices & High-Throughput Systems**

Kotlin Multiplatform, Rust, gRPC, Coroutines, async runtimes.

**Compiler / Tooling Development**

ANTLR, code generation, DSLs, emulation.
