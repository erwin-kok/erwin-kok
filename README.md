👋 **Hi, I'm Erwin Kok**

**Senior Software Engineer • 30+ Years Experience • Distributed Systems & Open-Source Enthusiast**

*(Most of my open-source work is built in my spare time — but I’m steadily expanding it.)*

I build scalable distributed systems, explore emerging networking protocols, and contribute to open-source technologies that power resilient modern infrastructure. With over three decades of experience across distributed systems, networking, cloud-native platforms, microservice architectures, and API design, I enjoy digging into complex technical problems and designing clean, elegant solutions. I love mentoring engineers, experimenting with Kotlin and Rust (still learning), and diving into deeply analytical subjects that challenge how things work at a low level.


Much of my professional work is proprietary, so my public GitHub largely reflects my spare-time experiments, prototypes, and ongoing open-source explorations.

🚀 **What I Work On**

**Distributed Computing / P2P Systems**

Design and prototyping of resilient, fault-tolerant peer-to-peer systems.

**Networking & Protocols**

QUIC, HTTP/3, CNI, service meshes, high-performance transport layers.

**Microservices & High-Throughput Systems**

Kotlin Multiplatform, Rust, gRPC, Coroutines, async runtimes.

**Compiler / Tooling Development**

ANTLR, code generation, DSLs, emulation.
