👋 **Hi, I'm Erwin Kok**

Senior Software Engineer • 30+ Years Experience
Distributed Systems, Networking, Compilers, and Infrastructure

I design and build distributed systems, developer tooling, and low-level infrastructure with an emphasis on correctness, scalability, and clear architectural boundaries. My experience spans distributed and peer-to-peer systems, networking protocols, cloud-native platforms, microservice architectures, and API design.

Much of my professional work has been in proprietary environments; my public GitHub focuses on selected open-source projects and technical explorations that reflect long-term interests in systems engineering, language implementation, and runtime behavior.

I value clear design, explicit tradeoffs, and pragmatic solutions to complex technical problems. I also enjoy mentoring engineers and contributing to engineering cultures that emphasize rigor, simplicity, and technical depth.

🚀 **What I Work On**


**[conjvm](https://github.com/erwin-kok/conjvm) — C subset compiler targeting the JVM**

Kotlin / ANTLR4 / JVM
A compiler for a well-defined subset of C, focusing on parsing, semantic analysis, SSA-style intermediate representations, and execution on the JVM.

**Distributed Computing / P2P Systems**

Design and prototyping of resilient, fault-tolerant peer-to-peer systems.

**Networking & Protocols**

QUIC, HTTP/3, CNI, service meshes, high-performance transport layers.

**Microservices & High-Throughput Systems**

Kotlin Multiplatform, Rust, gRPC, Coroutines, async runtimes.

**Compiler / Tooling Development**

ANTLR, code generation, DSLs, emulation.
